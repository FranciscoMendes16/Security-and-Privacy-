# Security-and-Privacy-

The aim of this curricular unit is to provide knowledge on advanced models and techniques for security and privacy of data and communications. 

It is expected that the following concepts are mastered: 

- The use of economic models to examine the cost-benefit tradeoff of information security

- Techniques for anonymization and assessment of the security level of anonymized data communications

- Data mining methods for security and privacy, particularly when applied to intrusion detection and authentication systems.


Beyond acquiring knowledge on the fundamentals of these areas, competences are expected to be gained in the analysis and validation of the presented security models and techniques through their application in real-world case studies.
